The Simple Crafting filter adds a simple display configuration to make it easier to find and craft items. Magical items that drop are modified to display their eligibility for crafting. For example: Vampirebone Gloves will be displayed as Blood Gloves. See the relevant wiki pages for more information. Intended for the average player with an interest in casually crafting items.
