***FILTER VERSIONS***

--------------------------

- **Standard**: The standard filter. Basic features and color schemes are enabled. Hides "bad" rares and generally worthless base items. Most "clutter" has been removed. Intended for the average player.
- **Simple Crafting**: Adds a simple display configuration to make it easier to find and craft items. Magical items that drop are modified to display their eligibility for crafting. *For example: Vampirebone Gloves will be displayed as Blood Gloves*. [See the wiki](https://github.com/Synial/pod-lootfilter/wiki) for more information. Intended for the average player with an interest in casually crafting items.
- **Advanced Crafting**: Adds an advanced display configuration to make it easy to craft the best items. Magical items that drop in endgame content are modified to display the requirements for the best crafting outcome. *For example: Vampirebone Gloves will have a different display depending on where the item dropped, and the level of the monster that dropped the item. Calculations have been made to limit the amount of bad affixes, and ensure the best affixes*. This filter allows those familiar with advanced crafting techniques to craft the best items while hunting monsters, rather than shopping for base items from vendors. [See the wiki](https://github.com/Synial/pod-lootfilter/wiki) for more information. Intended for the advanced player with a desire for the best outcome when crafting.
- **Public Game Enthuasiast**: Hides every item that is not above a certain value threshold. This will only display top-tier uniques, rare rings, rare amulets, small charms, grand charms, and runes numbered 24 (*Ist Rune*) and up. Designed for those playing in public games (*such as Baal runs*) that want to make sure they are only picking up good items if an item is picked up at all. This filter is also known as *The Scumbag Baal Runner*.
