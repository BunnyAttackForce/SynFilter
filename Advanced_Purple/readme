This version of the filter adds an advanced display configuration to make it easy to craft the best items. Magical items that drop in endgame content are modified to display the requirements for the best crafting outcome. For example: Vampirebone Gloves will have a different display depending on where the item dropped, and the level of the monster that dropped the item. Calculations have been made to limit the amount of bad affixes, and ensure the best affixes. This filter allows those familiar with advanced crafting techniques to craft the best items while hunting monsters, rather than shopping for base items from vendors. See the relevant wiki pages for more information. Intended for the advanced player with a desire for the best outcome when crafting.

The Advanced Filter includes settings found in the Standard filter that would not otherwise conflict with the new settings used in the Advanced Filter.
