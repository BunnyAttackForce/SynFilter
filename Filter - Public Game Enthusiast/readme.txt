This filter hides every item that is not above a certain value threshold. This will only display top-tier uniques, rare rings, rare amulets, rare jewels, small charms, grand charms, runes numbered 24 (Ist Rune) and up, and items otherwise considered very rare by the filter (like ethereal superior runeword bases). Designed for those playing in public games (such as Baal runs) that want to make sure they are only picking up good items if an item is picked up at all. This filter is also known as The Scumbag Baal Runner. Loot display rules follow my Item Tier List [a](https://github.com/Synial/SynFilter/projects/4?fullscreen=true).
